- Hi, I’m @yichenGao911(Gao Yichen), currently a graduate student at the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences, Peking University.
- I’m interested in planetary atmosphere, climate changes, and paleoclimate. I like watching baseball(online in China), and play slow pitch softball
  as a pitcher. I also enjoy playing games like Hollow Knight, Binding of Isaac, and most recently, Baldur's Gate 3.
- I’m currently learning modeling and other basic contents in atmospheric sciences.
- I’m looking to collaborate on exoplanets, especially using simple models to predict the climate on them.
- How to reach me: 1900011343@pku.edu.cn
